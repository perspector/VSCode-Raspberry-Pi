## Introduction
This repository installs visual studio code (code-oss) on your Raspberry Pi 3B+ or Raspberry Pi 4 easily.\
I was tired of doing hours of research and trying out commands to get Visual Studio Code, and have it not work.\
So, I made this repository which makes everything easier for you!

## Prerequisites
***_All the following commands are for Ubuntu/Debian_***
* An updated system `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y`
* Git: `sudo apt-get install git`

## Installation
All you have to do to install code-oss is to:
1. Open your terminal by pressing `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T`  on your keyboard.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/BennyThePythonCoder/VSCode-Raspberry-Pi.git`
3. Open the file directory: `cd VSCode*`
4. Run the script: `sh install.sh` _Note: It may ask you for your password to run the script._
